# Write-Ahead Log (WAL) Implementation

This directory contains the implementation of a Write-Ahead Log (WAL) system for data persistence in distributed systems. The WAL ensures data durability, consistency, and recovery in the face of system failures.

## Design Philosophy

The WAL implementation follows these key design principles:

1. **Loose coupling through interfaces**: Core components interact through well-defined interfaces, making the system highly modular and extensible
2. **Separation of concerns**: Each component has a single responsibility, making the system easier to maintain and test
3. **Domain-agnostic persistence layer**: The WAL doesn't make assumptions about data structure, allowing it to be used with various types of data
4. **Defensive programming**: Extensive error handling and validation to ensure data integrity
5. **Recovery-oriented design**: Operations are designed to be recoverable in case of failures

## Architecture

The implementation consists of several components that work together through a carefully designed interface hierarchy:

### Core Interfaces

1. **DataPersistenceInterface**

   - Defines the contract for data persistence operations
   - Methods: `persist(client_id, data, message_id)`, `retrieve(client_id)`, `clear(client_id)`
   - Implementations can vary (WAL, in-memory, database, etc.) without affecting clients

2. **StorageInterface**

   - Abstracts storage operations (file system, database, etc.)
   - Provides methods for reading/writing data, file management, and directory operations
   - Allows switching between different storage backends without changing WAL logic

3. **StateInterpreterInterface**
   - Handles formatting, parsing, and merging of domain-specific data
   - Makes data storage format independent from business logic
   - Allows the WAL to remain agnostic about the actual data structure

### Concrete Implementations

1. **WriteAheadLog**

   - Main implementation of `DataPersistenceInterface`
   - Uses log files for durability and checkpoints for efficiency
   - Handles recovery from system failures
   - Manages metadata to track processed messages and prevent duplicates
   - Implements intelligent cleanup of redundant logs and checkpoints

2. **FileSystemStorage**

   - Implementation of `StorageInterface` using local file system
   - Handles all file operations with appropriate error handling
   - Provides atomic file operations through careful write-then-update patterns
   - Abstracts away file system specific details

3. **ConsumerStateInterpreter**
   - Implementation of `StateInterpreterInterface` for consumer data
   - Formats/parses data specific to consumer operations
   - Separates business data format concerns from persistence mechanism
   - Handles merging of data from multiple logs during recovery

## How it Works

The WAL operates with the following workflow:

1. **Log Writing**:

   - When data needs to be persisted, it's first formatted by the StateInterpreter into a standard structure
   - Data is written to a log file with a unique operation ID (combination of timestamp and message ID)
   - Two-phase approach ensures durability:
     1. Write with "PROCESSING" status
     2. Update to "COMPLETED" status when write is successful
   - Integer message IDs are used for efficient tracking and comparison

2. **Message Deduplication**:

   - Each client has a record of the highest message ID processed
   - Incoming messages with IDs less than or equal to the max are skipped
   - Prevents duplicate processing in case of retries or system restarts

3. **Checkpointing**:

   - After a configurable number of logs are written (default: 3)
   - Recent logs are merged with existing checkpoint data using the StateInterpreter
   - A new checkpoint is created containing consolidated data and metadata
   - Structured metadata tracks the maximum message ID and timestamp
   - Old logs and previous checkpoint are removed after successful checkpoint creation

4. **Recovery**:

   - On startup, the system reads the latest checkpoint and all subsequent logs
   - The StateInterpreter merges data from all sources to reconstruct the most up-to-date state
   - Incomplete logs (those with "PROCESSING" status) are ignored
   - System recovers max message IDs to prevent reprocessing of messages

5. **Automatic Cleanup**:
   - On initialization, the WAL performs housekeeping:
     - Removes redundant logs (those with message IDs already covered by checkpoints)
     - Cleans up incomplete checkpoints (those with "PROCESSING" status)
     - Deletes old checkpoints (keeping only the most recent complete one)
   - Manual cleanup is available through the `clear()` method

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize components
storage = FileSystemStorage()
state_interpreter = ConsumerStateInterpreter()

# Create WAL instance
wal = WriteAheadLog(
    state_interpreter=state_interpreter,
    storage=storage,
    service_name="my_service",
    base_dir="/app/persistence"
)

# Persist data - note that message_id is now an integer
client_id = "client123"
data = {"content": "some important business data"}
message_id = 5  # Integer message ID for efficient processing
wal.persist(client_id, data, message_id)

# Retrieve data - recovery happens automatically if needed
retrieved_data = wal.retrieve(client_id)
print(retrieved_data)  # {'content': 'some important business data'}

# Clear data when no longer needed
wal.clear(client_id)
```

## Implementation Details

### Data Structure

1. **Log Files**:
   ```
   COMPLETED
   {"data": {...}, "_metadata": {"timestamp": "1621234567890", "message_id": 5}}
   ```

2. **Checkpoint Files**:
   ```
   COMPLETED
   {"content": "...", "_metadata": {"timestamp": "1621234567890", "max_message_id": 42}}
   ```

### Message ID Handling

- Message IDs are stored as integers for efficient comparison and ordering
- Internally, logs track both the external message ID and a timestamp-based ID
- Automatic conversion from legacy string IDs to integers for backward compatibility

### File Naming Conventions

- Log files: `log_[timestamp]_[message_id].log`
- Checkpoint files: `checkpoint_[timestamp].log`
- Client data segregation through client-specific directories

## Fault Tolerance Features

- **Durability**: Data is safely written to persistent storage through two-phase writes
- **Atomicity**: Operations are either completely applied or not visible at all
- **Consistency**: System maintains a consistent view of data through checkpoints and log ordering
- **Recoverability**: System state can be fully reconstructed after crashes or restarts
- **Idempotency**: Safe re-processing through message ID tracking
- **Checkpointing**: Regular consolidation improves efficiency and reduces recovery time
- **Housekeeping**: Automatic cleanup of stale and redundant data

## Extension Points

The WAL architecture is designed to be extensible:

1. **Alternative Storage Backends**
   - Implement `StorageInterface` for different storage systems like:
     - Cloud object storage (S3, GCS)
     - Distributed file systems (HDFS)
     - NoSQL databases

2. **Custom State Interpreters**
   - Implement `StateInterpreterInterface` for domain-specific data:
     - Different data formats (JSON, Protobuf, Avro)
     - Custom merging strategies
     - Schema validation and evolution

3. **Persistence Strategies**
   - Extend `DataPersistenceInterface` for different persistence approaches:
     - In-memory caching with persistence
     - Tiered storage strategies
     - Replicated storage for high availability

## Performance Considerations

- **Checkpointing Threshold**: Adjust the `CHECKPOINT_THRESHOLD` for your workload
  - Lower values: More frequent checkpoints, faster recovery, higher I/O overhead
  - Higher values: Less frequent checkpoints, slower recovery, lower I/O overhead

- **File System Impact**: Consider storage performance characteristics
  - SSD vs. HDD considerations
  - Network-attached storage latency
  - File system caching behavior
